\section{Introduction}
This is an example document that shows how to use the custom styles and macros provided by our typesetting package.
this is a test. When preparing LaTeX documents, it's helpful to refer to Lamport's definitive guide \cite{lamport1994latex}.

\section{Mathematical Typesetting}
Here are some examples of mathematical typesetting:

Inline math: $E = mc^2$ and displayed equations:
\begin{equation}
  \int_{a}^{b} f(x) \, dx = F(b) - F(a)
\end{equation}

Using our custom macros: $\R^n$ denotes n-dimensional real space. The expected value is denoted by $\E[X]$.
The fundamental principles of TeX were established by Knuth \cite{knuth1984texbook}.

\section{Formatting Features}
Here are some examples of our formatting macros:

Technical \term{terms} can be emphasized.

\highlight{Important information} can be highlighted.
